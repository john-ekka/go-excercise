blank identifier

The blank identifier is used to abandon the value, such as the value of 5 is abandoned in ` , b = 5, 7.

_, b = 5, 7

_ is actually a write-only variable and you cannot get its value. This is done because you must use all of the declared variables in the Go language, but sometimes you do not need to use all the return values you get from a function.

Because the Go language has a mandatory requirement, you must use the declared variable within the function, but the global variable that is not used is no problem.In order to avoid unused variables, the code will fail to compile, and we can change the unused variable to _.
